Hi there! I'm Mark, a Fayetteville, AR based software engineer.

## Projects

I recently built a [running pace calculator](https://mwinn616.github.io/run-calculator/) to quickly figure out the needed pace to run a specific race distance or time.


Most recently, I've been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
